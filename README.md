# airbnb-clone-repository
## 🏡 Project Overview This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. The goal is to **recreate a simplified version of the AirBnB web application**, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of backend development and object-oriented programming in Python. The project will be developed in phases, starting with a command-line interface for managing AirBnB objects, and later expanding into a fully functional web application.
---
## 🎯 Project Goals - Understand and implement object-oriented programming in Python - Build a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB data - Create custom classes and handle serialization/deserialization - Transition the project to use storage engines (File and DB) - Eventually develop a web interface for the application
---
## 🧰 Tech Stack - **Language:** Python 3.8+ - **Storage:** File storage (JSON), SQL (later stage) - **Frameworks:** Flask (web development in later stages) - **Tools:** Git, Unit Testing, Command Line 
---
## 🚀 Getting Started To get started:
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/airbnb-clone-project.git

## Team Roles

The AirBnB Clone project involves multiple roles, each with specific responsibilities to ensure smooth development and delivery:

- **Backend Developer**  
  Designs and implements the server-side logic, APIs, and core application functionality. Responsible for data processing and business rules.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Manages database design, optimization, data integrity, and migrations. Ensures efficient and secure data storage and retrieval.

- **QA Engineer**  
  Creates and executes test plans to ensure software quality. Responsible for identifying bugs and verifying fixes through automated and manual testing.

- **DevOps Engineer**  
  Automates deployment processes, manages CI/CD pipelines, and maintains the infrastructure for reliable application delivery.

- **Frontend Developer**  
  Develops the client-side interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Connects UI elements with backend APIs to create interactive user experiences.

- **Project Manager**  
  Coordinates project tasks, manages timelines, facilitates communication among team members, and ensures project goals are met.

- **Research & Documentation Lead**  
  Collects technical information, writes documentation, and maintains project knowledge to help the team stay aligned and informed.

> *Note: Roles may overlap or evolve based on project phases and team size.*

## 🧰 Technology Stack This project uses a range of modern technologies to build and manage the backend functionality of the AirBnB Clone. Below is an overview of the key technologies and their roles in the project:
| Technology | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python** | The core programming language used for writing all backend logic and modules. | 
| **Flask** | A lightweight Python web framework used to create RESTful APIs and manage server-side routing (used in later phases). |
| **MySQL** | A relational database system used for storing persistent data such as users, places, and bookings. | 
| **SQLAlchemy** | An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that helps interact with the MySQL database using Python objects instead of SQL queries. |
| **HTML/CSS** | (Frontend - Later Phase) Used to structure and style the web interface of the application. | 
| **JavaScript** | (Frontend - Later Phase) Adds interactivity to the UI and communicates with backend APIs. |
| **Git** | Version control tool used to track changes, manage branches, and collaborate as a team. |
| **GitHub** | Remote repository hosting platform for code collaboration and project documentation. | 
| **Unittest** | Python’s built-in testing framework used to write and run test cases to ensure code quality. |
