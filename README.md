## 🗃️ Database Design
The database for the AirBnB Clone project is designed to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments efficiently. Below is an overview of the key entities and their fields, along with the relationships between them.
# 🧑‍💼 1. Users Represents users of the platform including hosts and guests. **Key Fields:** - `id` (Primary Key) - `name` - `email` - `password_hash` - `user_type` (host or guest)
---
# 🏠 2. Properties Represents the listings or accommodations available for booking. **Key Fields:** - `id` (Primary Key) - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users) - `title` - `description` - `location` - `price_per_night`
--- 
# 📅 3. Bookings Captures booking details made by guests for a property. **Key Fields:** - `id` (Primary Key) - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users) - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties) - `check_in_date` - `check_out_date` - `total_price`
--- 
# 🌟 4. Reviews Allows users to leave feedback on properties. **Key Fields:** - `id` (Primary Key) - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users) - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties) - `rating` (1–5) - `comment` 
---
# 💳 5. Payments Tracks transactions for bookings. **Key Fields:** - `id` (Primary Key) - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings) - `amount` - `payment_method` - `payment_status` 
---

# 🔁 Entity Relationships 
- **One-to-Many:** A **User** can have multiple **Properties**
- **One-to-Many:** A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**
- **One-to-Many:** A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**
- **One-to-Many:** A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**
- **One-to-One:** A **Booking** has one **Payment** > This relational structure ensures clean data separation and scalability as more features are added to the project.

The AirBnB Clone project consists of several core features that replicate key functionalities of the real AirBnB platform:

- **User Management**  
  Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. Users can sign up as guests or hosts, log in securely, and manage their personal information and bookings.

- **Property Management**  
  Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, location, description, images, and pricing, enabling hosts to manage their accommodations.

- **Booking System**  
  Enables guests to search for available properties, select dates, and make bookings. It includes validation to prevent double bookings and calculates the total price based on the length of stay.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Simulates or integrates payment processing to handle transactions securely. Tracks payment status to ensure confirmation before finalizing bookings.

- **Reviews & Ratings**  
  Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings for properties after their stay. This feature helps build trust and improves the overall user experience by providing valuable insights.

- **Search and Filtering** (Planned)  
  Provides users with the ability to search properties by location, price range, and availability. Advanced filters like amenities and ratings will enhance search accuracy and user convenience.

  Securing the backend APIs of the AirBnB Clone is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure a safe experience for users. The following security measures will be implemented throughout the project:

- **Authentication**  
  Verifies the identity of users through secure login mechanisms (e.g., email and password with hashed storage). Authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints and prevents impersonation.

- **Authorization**  
  Determines what actions a user is allowed to perform based on their role (e.g., guest, host, admin). This prevents users from accessing or modifying data that does not belong to them (e.g., a guest trying to edit a host's property).

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**  
  Ensures that all incoming data is properly validated and cleaned before being processed. This helps prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and data corruption.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Limits the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a certain time frame. This protects the system from brute force attacks, abuse, and denial-of-service (DoS) threats.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest where applicable. This prevents data leakage during network transmission or server compromise.

- **Token-Based Access (e.g., JWT)**  
  Secure tokens will be used to manage authenticated sessions. This allows stateless authentication and ensures that user sessions are securely managed across multiple API requests.

### Why Security is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data:** User information, including personal details and passwords, must be secured to maintain trust and comply with data protection standards.
- **Securing Payments:** Payment data and transaction records are highly sensitive and must be handled securely to prevent fraud or theft.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access:** Ensures that users can only access the data and features that they are permitted to, reducing the risk of data leaks or manipulation.
- **Ensuring Platform Integrity:** Security safeguards help keep the platform stable, reliable, and free from abuse or malicious activity.

- ## CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. In the context of the AirBnB Clone project, CI/CD ensures that updates to the application are tested and deployed reliably and quickly, improving overall code quality and team productivity.

### Why CI/CD is Important:

- **Automated Testing:** Ensures every code change is tested automatically to prevent bugs and regressions.
- **Faster Deployment:** Speeds up the process of deploying new features, fixes, and improvements to production or staging environments.
- **Consistency:** Reduces human error by standardizing build and deployment processes.
- **Early Feedback:** Detects issues early in the development lifecycle, saving time and effort later.

### Tools That Can Be Used:

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows such as testing, linting, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker:** Used to containerize the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / Azure:** Cloud platforms that can host and automatically deploy the app.
- **Pytest / Unittest:** Testing frameworks used during CI to validate code quality.
- **Flake8 / Black:** Code formatting and linting tools that help maintain clean, readable code as part of the pipeline.

> CI/CD plays a crucial role in modern software development by making code delivery faster, safer, and more efficient for teams working on complex applications like the AirBnB Clone.
