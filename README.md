# airbnb-clone-repository
## 🏡 Project Overview This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. The goal is to **recreate a simplified version of the AirBnB web application**, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of backend development and object-oriented programming in Python. The project will be developed in phases, starting with a command-line interface for managing AirBnB objects, and later expanding into a fully functional web application.
---
## 🎯 Project Goals - Understand and implement object-oriented programming in Python - Build a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB data - Create custom classes and handle serialization/deserialization - Transition the project to use storage engines (File and DB) - Eventually develop a web interface for the application
---
## 🧰 Tech Stack - **Language:** Python 3.8+ - **Storage:** File storage (JSON), SQL (later stage) - **Frameworks:** Flask (web development in later stages) - **Tools:** Git, Unit Testing, Command Line 
---
## 🚀 Getting Started To get started:
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/airbnb-clone-project.git
